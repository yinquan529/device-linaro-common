Instructions for https://android-build.linaro.org/builds/~berolinux/nexus7-jb-gcc47-aosp-blob/

= Get artifacts =

  (You don't need the artifacts if you wish to build from source)

  Scroll down to the 'Downloads' section

  Click on each link to download:
    boot.img
    system.img
    userdata.img

= Get and build source =

  (You don't need the source if you wish to install from the binaries)

  $ mkdir linaro-nexus7
  $ cd linaro-nexus7
  $ repo init -u git://android.git.linaro.org/ -b linaro-playground -m staging-nexus7.git
  $ repo sync
  $ make TARGET_PRODUCT=full_grouper TARGET_TOOLS_PREFIX=/path/to/your/linaro/android/toolchain/bin/arm-linux-androideabi- droidcore -j4

= Get merge-nexus7-blobs script =

  The script is available from:

  http://android.git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=device/asus/grouper.git;a=blob_plain;f=merge-nexus7-blobs;hb=linaro-playground

  or from git:

  $ git clone git://android.git.linaro.org/device/asus/grouper.git
  $ cd grouper
  $ git checkout -b linaro-playground origin/linaro-playground

  Make sure your computer is connected to the Internet, since
  the script downloads non-free binaries and tools to extract images.

  Run merge-nexus7-blobs script, giving the directory containing the .img files
  as its sole argument.

  The script will do the remaining bits for you, including flashing the tablet.

  WARNING: There is no guarantee whatsoever that the build will work.
           If it breaks your tablet, you get to keep both pieces.

= Install Google Apps =

If you wish to use the device as a real tablet rather than a pure development
device, chances are that you want to install the Google Apps on it:

  * Install the Linaro Android build as described above

  * Grab the current Google Apps zip for KitKat from http://dongworkmod.org/gapps
    At the time of the writing, the current version is:
    http://dongworkmod.org/gapps/gapps-kk-20131119.zip

  * If you downloaded from a device other than your Nexus 7, transfer
    the file to your Nexus 7 using:

    mtp-sendfile gapps-kk*.zip 8

  * Turn your Nexus 7 off completely

  * Hold down the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons at the same time, and turn
    on the device

  * Use the Volume Up button to select "Recovery mode", then press the power
    button to launch it. Wait for recovery to come up.

  * Select "install zip from sdcard"

  * Select "choose zip from sdcard"

  * Choose the gapps-kk zip file you downloaded earlier (it should be in the
    Download/ folder)

  * Select "Yes - Install gapps-kk-*.zip"

  * Select "+++++Go Back+++++"

  * Select "reboot system now"

  * Enjoy your Google Apps enabled Linaro Android build!

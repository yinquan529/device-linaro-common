Instructions for https://android-build.linaro.org/builds/~linaro-android/nexus7-2012-linaro/

= Get artifacts =

  Scroll down to the 'Downloads' section

  Click on each link to download:
    boot.img
    system.img
    userdata.img

= Get merge-gnexus-blobs script =

  The script is available from:

  http://android.git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=device/asus/grouper.git;a=blob_plain;f=merge-gnexus-blobs;hb=linaro_android_4.4

  or from git:

  $ git clone git://android.git.linaro.org/device/asus/grouper.git
  $ cd grouper
  $ git checkout -b linaro_android_4.4 origin/linaro_android_4.4

  Make sure your computer is connected to the Internet, since the script downloads non-free binaries and tools to extract images.

  Run the merge-gnexus-blobs script, giving the directory containing the .img files as its sole argument.

  The script will do the remaining bits for you, including flashing the phone.

  WARNING: There is no guarantee whatsoever that the build will work. If it breaks your phone, you get to keep both pieces.

= Install Google Apps =

  If you wish to use the device as a real tablet rather than a pure development device, chances are that you want to install the Google Apps on it:

  * Install the Linaro Android build as described above

    At the time of the writing, the current version is:

  * If you downloaded from a device other than your Nexus 7, transfer
    the file to your Nexus 7 using:

    mtp-sendfile gapps-jb*.zip 8

  * Turn your Nexus 7 off completely

  * Hold down the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons at the same time, and turn
    on the tablet

  * Use the Volume Up button to select "Recovery mode", then press the power
    button to launch it. Wait for recovery to come up.

  * Select "install zip from sdcard"

  * Select "choose zip from sdcard"

  * Choose the gapps-jb zip file you downloaded earlier (it should be in the
    Download/ folder)
